We characterize the filtering properties of a thin metal-dielectric-metal multilayer structure evaporated by physical vapor deposition. We present the measurements of transmission spectra, and of surface roughness, as well as the simulation results showing the sensitivity of structure properties to surface roughness. Surface roughness is found to be the major factor that limits the theoretical filtering properties of the structure.}, number={2}, journal={Photonics Letters of Poland}, author={Stolarek, Marcin and Wróbel, Piotr and Stefaniuk, Tomasz and Wlazło, Mateusz and Pastuszczak, Anna and Kotyński, Rafał}, year={2013}, pages={60–62}}

abstract = {We report on experimental evidence of unidirectional transmission of terahertz waves through a pair of metallic gratings with different periods. The gratings are optimized for a broadband transmission in one direction, accompanied with a high extinction rate in the opposite direction. In contrast to previous studies, we show that the zero-order nonreciprocity cannot be achieved. Nonetheless, we confirm that the structure can be used successfully as an asymmetric filter.},

abstract = {We report on unidirectional and asymmetric transmission of radially polarized THz radiation through a dual circular metallic grating with sub-wavelength slits. Unidirectional transmission is shown theoretically for a super-Gaussian incident beam, and an asymmetric transmission is demonstrated experimentally, when the radially polarized beam of 0.1 THz is obtained by converting a linearly polarized beam with a discontinuous phase retarder and a tapered waveguide. The dual grating does not include nonlinear materials, its operation is reciprocal, and analogous to that of some planar metallic gratings.},
