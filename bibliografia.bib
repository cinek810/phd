The materials silicon oxide, silicon nitride, aluminum oxide, aluminum nitride, and titanium oxide are prepared using room temperature reactive sputter deposition and are characterized using MIR variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry. The investigation shows how sensitive the refractive index functions are to the O2 and N2 flow rates, and for which growth conditions the materials deposit homogeneously. It also allows conclusions to be drawn on the degree of amorphousness and roughness. To facilitate comparison of the materials deposited in this work with others, the index of refraction was also determined and provided for the near-IR and visible ranges of the spectrum. The results presented here should serve as a useful information base for designing optical coatings for the MIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The results are parameterized to allow them to be easily used for coating design.},

The dual grating does not include nonlinear materials, its operation is reciprocal, and analogous to that of some planar metallic gratings.},

We demonstrate thatthrough properly designed symmetric and asymmetric compensated prismpair structures planar image rotation with arbitrary angle, lateral image shift,as well as image magnification could be achieved with sub-wavelengthresolution. Both theoretical analysis and full wave electromagneticsimulations have been employed to verify the properties of the proposedprism structures. Utilizing the proposed AMM prisms, flat optical image ofobjects with sub-wavelength features can be projected and magnified towavelength scale allowing for further optical processing of the image byconventional optics.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the propagation of light through silver-dielectric metamaterial layered prism which operates in the canalization regime. The prism is illuminated with TM-polarized light and is designed using the effective medium theory as strongly anisotropic and impedance matched to air. The structure has an infinite value of the effective permittivity in the direction perpendicular to layer surfaces. Therefore it is able to couple a broad spectrum of incident spatial frequencies, including evanescent waves, into propagating modes. As a result, subwavelength resolution at the output interface of the structure is observed. Further the device is characterised with the transfer matrix method (TMM), and investigated with Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD). Two parameters of the prism are studied, namely the angle of incidence and the apex angle, to obtain the best resolution.},
